# About Me
I am a machine learning researcher and software engineering enthusiastic. I have completer my Ph.D. in Information Systems (AI and Machine Learning Track) graduate from the [Information Systems Department](https://informationsystems.umbc.edu/) at [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://www.umbc.edu/). During my PhD I have worked on developing supervised and semi-supervised semantic segmentation for natural disaster damamge assessment. I have also developed two datasets, FloodNet and RescueNet, which contains pixel-level annotation of post-disaster images.

During my PhD, I have completed two internships. In my first internship at Intel, I have worked on a NLP project where I have developed a prototype software that can classify paging messages using unsupervised text clusting methods. At my second internship at Comcast, I have worked with LLM (BERT, T5, Vicuna) and Computer Vision models (Large Vision Language Models - e.g. CLIP, MiniGPT-4, LLaVA) to develop a distillation framework for image classification task. I did reseach on prompt engineering to generate context for different images to make a image-context dataset to further improve the distillation training by integrating *rationale* for the each image data. 

Prior to joining UMBC as a graduate student, I completed my MS in Electrical Engineering from The University of Toledo. 
After my MS, I worked as Software Development Engineer in [Fluence Automation](https://www.fluenceautomation.com/) and POST-IS. I have worked in designing and developing embeded PC based softwares using C++ and user interfaces using C#.

# Research Interests
My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of NLP, Transformer, Computer Vision, Generative Modeling, and Large Language Model. 

# Blog
I have been writing about different machine learning concepts (both theory and applications). The topics includes concepts on NLP, Computer Vision, and LLM. I have also started writing about different software engineering design concepts and best practice. These blogs sometimes might be incomplete, since they are my notes on those concepts. I will keep adding contents on each topic.

# Recent News
