# About Me
I am a recent Ph.D. in Information Systems graduate from the [Information Systems Department](https://informationsystems.umbc.edu/) at [University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)](https://www.umbc.edu/), 
advised by [Dr. Maryam Rahnemoonfar](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/faculty/maryam-rahnemoonfar). During my PhD I have worked on developing supervised and semi-supervised semantic segmentation for natural disaster damamge assessment. I have also developed two datasets, FloodNet and RescueNet, which contains pixel-level annotation of post-disaster images.

During my PhD, I have completed two internships. During my first internship at Intel, I have worked on developing a prototype software that classify paging messages using unsupervised text clusting method. At my second internship at Comcast I have worked with large vision language models like MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA to develop transfer learning models for image classification task.

Prior to joining UMBC as a graduate student, I completed my MS in Electrical Engineering from The University of Toledo. 
After my MS, I worked as Software Development Engineer in [Fluence Automation](https://www.fluenceautomation.com/) and POST-IS. I have worked in designing and developing embeded PC based softwares using C++ and user interfaces using C#.

# Research Interests
My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning and artificial intelligence, particularly in the area of semantic segmentation, Vision Transformer, Self-Attention, Generative Modeling, and Large Language Model. 

# Recent News
* I have successfully defended my dissertation on April 15, 2024.
* Our second dataset RescueNet paper has been published at Scientific Data, Nature titled **RescueNet: a High Resolution UaVSemantic Segmentation Datasetfor Natural Disaster Damage Assessment**. Feel free to check out the paper [here](https://rdcu.be/dt3kU)
